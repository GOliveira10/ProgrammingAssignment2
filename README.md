### Introduction

This is my attempt at Programming Assignment 2 in R Programming, the second unit of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization. The purpose of the assignment was to practiced what we had learned earlier in regards to R's usage of lexical scoping. The function itself creates a simple way to cache matrix inversions for later so we don't have to continually reinvert matrices we have already inverted and waste time and memory. It demonstrates how we can use functions to influence the global environment and greatly expands their usefulness.
